Builds and tests startup time of lisp images.

Creates a bare and "big" image.  The big image just loads the drakma system.

Requrements:

* A working cl-launch installed and symlinked to /usr/bin/cl
* Quicklisp (only used for drakma; it could be made to work without fairly
  easily)

To run:

edit "config" to contain a list of lisp implementations you wish to test.  It
is parsed by a bourne style shell and passed to cl-launch.

Then just run the executable "do"  By default it runs 100 iterations of each test, so will take a while (particularly if ecl is being tested).

Output is:

A header for each lisp version being tested

Then SIZE EXENAME CPU% WALL-TIME

/bin/true is included as a reference point.
